# Project = Data Plan Adjustment

The purporse of this project is to automatize the mobile data plan adjustment in a big company according to the data consumption for each user of the last three months. 

Each user has a phone number with a data plan package. This data plan package can be of x, y, z, w, u or r GB per month. 
For the purpose of cost reduction, we want to make sure that each user has the data plan package which fits best their consumption. 

For example, a user that has a 8GB is using in month 1, 30GB; in month 2, 32GB; and in month 3, 34GB. 
The user has been booking data passes, which are more expensive than the data plans.  
With this program, we can see that the user can have a data plan adjustment from 8GB to 30GB, saving up costs.  

The final code is in the file main.py.
To test the code, please also download the test_month1.xlsx, test_month2.xlsx, and test_month3.xlsx files. 
Make sure the data files are in the same folder as the project folder. 
When prompt, just copy the path or drag them from the folder to the terminal.
